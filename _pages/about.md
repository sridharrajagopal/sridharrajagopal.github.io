I am an Entrepreneur, Software Engineer, Maker & Tinkerer, with over 25 years experience in engineering complex software systems and a seasoned tinkerer of bits and bytes. Formally bitten by the Maker Movement bug in 2012 when I attended my first Maker Faire in San Mateo, I am also keenly interested in getting my hands dirty with all things related to making. Dr. Wattson energy monitoring board, BuffI the Ampere Slayer, and ProtoStax, a "lego" for electronic project enclosures are some of my maker creations. My interests range from distributed systems, music programming (especially around South Indian Classical Music Theoretical concepts), to internet-of-things and developing and utilizing on-device ML. I am deeply interested in the effects of air pollution exposure (especially indoor air quality) on health and wellness and finding quantifiable ways of reducing exposure and improving wellness.

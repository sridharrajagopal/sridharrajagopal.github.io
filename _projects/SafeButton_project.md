**Summary**

Safe Button was a smart personal safety alarm that not only sounded a
loud audible alarm but also notified friends and family of your
location at the press of a button. It was done as part of the Bay Area
Maker Startup Weekend Hackathon in July 2014.

Startup Weekend is a 54 hour hackathon, starting on a Friday evening
and continuing through to Sunday evening. People pitch ideas on Friday
which get voted on, and then the participants coalesce into different
groups around the selected ideas, develop a working prototype, demo,
and VC presentation by Sunday evening.

The Startup Weekend at the San Jose Tech museum in July 2014 was a
Maker event with a hardware focus. My idea for Safe Button was among
the top ideas and I ended up forming a team around it. We won the Best
Customer Validation award at the VC presentation on Sunday.

**Contributions**

The Safe Button team consisted of 9 members (including an honorary kid
member!). We worked together to create a working demo-able prototype,
and business plan with customer data and validation, and a final VC
presentation. As Founder (having pitched the idea), I coordinated
among the different team members in realizing the vision, but every
single one pulled their weight with a division of labor.
